38094,40893,2/17/2003,4,Great with a salad. Cooked on top of stove for 15 minutes.Added a shake of cayenne and a pinch of salt.  Used low fat sour cream.  Thanks.
1293707,40893,12/21/2011,5,"So simple, so delicious! Great for chilly fall evening. Should have doubled it ;)<br/><br/>Second time around, forgot the remaining cumin. We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!"
8937,44394,12/1/2002,4,This worked very well and is EASY.  I used not quite a whole package (10oz) of white chips.  Great!
126440,85009,2/27/2010,5,I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko.  Everyone loved it.
57222,85009,10/1/2011,5,"Made the cheddar bacon topping, adding a sprinkling of black pepper. Yum!"
52282,120345,5/21/2005,4,very very sweet. after i waited the 2 days i bought 2 more pints of raspberries and added them to the mix. i'm going to add some as a cake filling today and will take a photo.
124416,120345,8/6/2011,0,"Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears."
2000192946,120345,5/10/2015,2,"This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!"
76535,134728,9/2/2005,4,Very good!
273745,134728,12/22/2005,5,Better than the real!!
353911,134728,9/26/2006,5,"Absolutely AWESOME! I was speechless when I tried them. I've never had such juicy melt-in-your-mouth chicken made AT HOME! I would, however, suggest to reduce the amount of flour. 2 cups was overkill for me. "
190375,134728,3/9/2007,5,These taste absolutely wonderful!!  My son-in-law loves them and requests them often! I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.
468945,134728,2/20/2008,0,"Made my own buttermilk w/ vinegar and milk.  Used defrosted fresh skinless/boneless chicken fillets.  3 lbs. This mix is extremely flavorful and its light .  I didnt do the bbq thing, but while I cooked homemade to go w/ this I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and served bbq dipping sauce.  10 stars from my kids !"
255338,134728,4/11/2008,5,"First time using liquid smoke in a recipe. Made this as directed. My kids enjoyed this, so we will make this again. Thank you for posting."
1171894,134728,4/21/2009,5,"MMMMM! This is so good! I actually soaked the chicken in chicken bouillon first, and it made it super flavorful. I use Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (DH's favorite), and cut chicken into nuggets instead of strips. This makes a good amount, so you could really freeze some and reheat in oven later. Those were our plans, but it was so good that it didn't make it to the ziploc bag!"
136726,197160,11/25/2006,5,"I used this mix to make meat balls.Very simple to put together.  I made a batch to put in the freezer too. I find meatballs are really handy to have around just add sauce and cheese for pasta meal or appetizer or for subs or snack.  These turned out to be very good I did add some garlic, but other than that I followed the recipe. The cinnamon in this added something to this that sets it apart from most meatball recipes I tried. Thanks for posting."
68960,200236,12/19/2006,4,"We really enjoyed this and so did both my young daughters. For this recipe I decided my crockpot would be perfect. I basically followed the recipe exactally except instead of adding the flour to the onions, I made a mix of flour, salt and pepper in a bag and then tossed the lamb to coat before browning. I added the spices to the onion/garlic to toast them slightly before deglazing with stock. Because I used the crockpot I cut the stock back to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup and used all the canned tomatoes. I added the canned chickpeas about an hour before serving.  This ended up cooking in the crockpot on low for about 6-7 hours. Served with Recipe #96875 this is a fabulous, filling family meal. Thank you for posting."
618928,200236,10/17/2007,4,this is an excellent got 'lamb and a tin of chickpeas what should I cook' recipe. I used our slow cooker too. I made it for 4-5 people ( so 680grms lamb).I followed the recipe but used a can of tomatoes and alittle stock ( maybe 1/4 cup) and transfered the simmered tomatoes to the lamb waiting in the slow cooker. On low for about 5-6 hrs perfect!
217118,200236,4/18/2008,5,"This was a lovely Morrocan style dish. I halved the recipe and made it on the stove top like a stew. I added a bit more stock to keep it from drying out. I left off the parsley and/or cilantro, didn't have any. Served with some warm pita type flat breads. I have a VERY picky Husband that even enjoyed this dish."
2000049093,200236,3/8/2015,5,"I love lamb stew and usually make an Irish version with potatoes, celery, carrots, onions or something close.  Now and then I&#039;m looking for a change of pace.  Using this recipe as a basis this turned out a really tasty and healthy lamb stew.   I plan to alternate this with the Irish style.  Mmm. I used the canned tomatoes, chickpeas, onion, garlic, also a little celery, a jalapeno pepper, and diced-up carrot and malanga root.  Used cumin, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary,  and cloves as well as salt and pepper. Nice peppy flavor. Looks great as well, if I get the camera working hope to send a picture."
202555,225241,6/20/2007,5,"My husband has just found out that he had to cut down on fat. He..like a lot of Okies is a solid meat and potato guy. It has been really hard to find things that he likes to eat but this recipe fit the bill. Has a wonderful flavor and we didn't miss the beef at all with this. I would highly recommend!!!"
353579,225241,8/14/2007,5,"Very good, made with ingredients I usually have.  I didn't want to heat up my kitchen, so I did the final cooking in the microwave, which worked just fine.  Thanks for posting!"
635209,225241,11/6/2007,4,"Thought this was a great Core recipe.  My 79-year-old mom loved it too.  I did multiply the proportions x 3 or 4 so I could use whole cans of beans/Ro-tel tomatoes.  Also just added whole egg to the topping due to time and it was very good, but probably not as light as with egg white. I also was out of chicken broth and just used water and upped the seasonings; and used part shredded chicken and part canned chicken breast.  I made it spicy and served it with fat-free sour cream on top.  A winner!!"
681408,225241,3/14/2008,0,This is a very good recipe.  We also want to cut back on the fat content in our diet . Very tasty dish!!!
684460,225241,1/18/2009,5,We really liked this recipe - something different with chicken is always good to find.  The topping is really good - the kids thought it looked like a twinkie.  They really liked it; even if it wasn't a giant twinkie.
900992,225241,2/19/2009,3,"The ""cornbread"" on top is bland. I'd us a real cornbread recipe and put it on top instead."
135017,254596,9/29/2007,5,"I am extremely picky about my crockpot recipes (don't like most). This one was great! I made a half-recipe with 1 lb. of pork chops. Because my crockpot tends to burn meat (it's old, with the element on the bottom), I put the fruit mixture in first, then put the chops on top. I then spooned some of the fruit mixture on top of the meat. While at work I remembered I forgot to halve the wine (hee hee) but they still turned out just fine. Thanks, lazyme! P.S.  I forgot to note that I did not do the cornstarch part and it was fine -- it made a juicy gravy that was nice with the mashed potatoes I also made.  Also, I did not have fresh cranberries and used a scant 1/2 cup of craisins instead, and that was fine, too.  It's all good, lazyme!"
224088,254596,10/21/2007,4,"Pork + fruit + crockpot = awesome.
582223,254596,12/9/2007,5,really good my 18 month old loved it and she's really picky. I wasn't sure what type of wine to use so I used red. Thanks for the recipe!
1413963,254596,10/15/2009,5,One word says it all . Delicious!!!
483827,306785,7/15/2008,5,Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .
56680,79222,11/11/2006,5,"Oh, This was wonderful!  Had a soup and salad dinner and most people barely ate salad, LOL.  This doubled easily and reheats well too!"
5060,310237,5/7/2010,5,"wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting."
935485,321038,6/22/2009,5,Being a healthy bar this is very good.  I make just a couple of changes.  I used stevia instead of splenda.  I used recipe #81194 for the egg substitue.  And I used pure vanilla extract instead of the coffee mate.  I will be making a lot of these!
539686,321038,3/28/2011,5,My very health conscious daughter and I tripled this recipe and love them as cookie-sized treats. Very filling and healthy too. Thanks for posting.
6258,20930,7/9/2002,5,"Jan, what an interesting combination of flavors. Really unique and very tasty.  I am so proud of myself because I am growing an herb garden and I had the chives and oregano (fresh).  You didn't specify whether the sundried tomatoes were oil packed or dry, so I chose the dry ones since you had olive oil listed.  I didn't have the pine nuts, so I used sunflower seeds, and that worked out well.  I loved eating this salad...no real cooking on a hot evening.  I will make this one again.  I am wondering how fresh tarragon would be instead of the oregano?  Maybe I will be brave and make it that way soon.  If I do, I will let you know how the substitution fit in.  Thanks for posting this one!"
102602,20930,10/26/2003,5,"Jan, we love your pasta salad, it's delicious. I've never used chives in a pasta salad before, it adds a very nice flavor. I made a few changes, I omitted the bacon and served the pine nuts on the side (DS HATES pine nuts). I added some extra garlic, a grating of parmesan cheese and some fresh basil (couldn't resist, it's grows right next to the oregano and chives in my garden). I'll be making this again... soon. Thanks for posting this recipe! "
172467,29093,8/24/2009,5,"Lucious cake, firm on the outside, warm and creamy inside. Looks like you slaved away all day but the directions are easy. I will definitely make this again. it's a keeper! Thanks for posting."
2042100,29093,10/23/2011,5,"Amazing recipe! The cakes taste even better than the ones you get in most restaurants. Everyone loves it! Easy and on the spot.<br/><br/>Usually I divide it by 3, since there's only my fiancee and me in my house and the regular amount can last for a week."
2002068522,29093,3/26/2018,0,i made it and it was amazing
58332,41090,2/25/2003,4,"The flavor of the vinegar was a little too ""whang!"" for me so I added a little olive oil.  This tempered the acidity and made a really good lunch. Thank you!"
160497,41090,4/22/2007,5,"I have made this several times now.  I substitute regular white vinegar for the white wine vinegar and the whole family enjoys this!  The dressing does not overwhelm the flavors of the vegetables. I also have doubled the recipe, using one can black beans and one can red beans with two cans white beans for a different color combination."
67026,60656,5/8/2004,4,Good basic recipe that i used as the basis of some great red sauce.  Thanks!
183565,79222,2/13/2006,5,"Wow!  My family loves this recipe and it is a great winter meal.  I do have to say that I adjusted a little but the base remains the same.  Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey."
101823,79222,3/21/2006,5,"Excellent chowder.  This was the perfect warm-up at the end of a cold, snowy day.  I used more crab meat than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the directions.  This was so simple, and worked well to put in the crockpot to keep warm while I waited for Hubby to come home for the evening.  We will make this again."
349752,79222,4/7/2007,5,"Tasty, low fat, fast & easy!  I added 1tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and 1 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning with a 14 oz. can of crab.  We all like the extra spice.  This recipe would satisfy DH & DS without any side dishes, but I offered saltines & a salad on the side just in case.  Definitely a keeper!"
446143,79222,2/1/2008,4,"Oh, how wonderful!  I doubled the crab, and added some carrots (and some extra broth to compensate.)  We still thought there should be more crab though.  The nutmeg flavor was wonderful and the cayenne added a tiny kick.  Lovely recipe PCS!"
226989,79222,3/7/2008,4,"DH and I enjoyed this. However I used it only as a base for a potato/seafood chowder. I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again."
868654,79222,10/7/2008,5,"Along with the onions we added in a square of salt pork, and fried them up till they were crisp.  We loved this soup, and we will definately have it again when we get the craving for something to warm the tummy!  Thank you!"
1143059,79222,2/12/2009,4,"I made this last nite and it was pretty good.  I will make it again, but am thinking it needs something else.  For one thing, there was no salt in the recepie and I did add that...I think next time Im going to add some shrimp and maybe more spices as I thought it was somewhat bland."
302867,79222,1/5/2010,5,Delish!  Part of my New Years resolution....  rate recipes I've tried.  Substituted Old Bay for cayenne.  Will make again.  Thanks for a keeper!
1316788,79222,2/12/2010,5,Fantastic! I used a little bit of cream since I like a thicker chowder. This was perfect though! A seafood party favorite!
1447190,79222,3/18/2010,5,"really good,I did make adjustments to my needs I used soymilk,and left out cayenne,I added 1 box container of chicken broth which I think was 32 oz? I also chopped the potatoes and onions to a mush in a food chopper so it was easier on my digestion and I served over jasmine rice."
1003295,79222,3/26/2010,5,"I might be slightly biased because I love crab in any and everything, but this was fantastic. I use cream instead of regular milk for a creamier chowder."
930021,79222,6/25/2010,5,"My favorite chowder ever. I may try it with other sea food in future. I wasn't sure about the amounts of garlic and nutmeg, but they blend in really well. I added a couple of dashes of cream."
241697,79222,7/10/2010,5,Really great recipe!! Although I did not have creamed corn..i added extra broth. It thickened up really nice!! Thank-You
980899,79222,10/18/2010,0,"I used half cream and half 1% milk, added another 1/2c cream at the end. Was without nutmeg. Added nearly a whole pkg of bacon and two 6 oz cans of crab. I will come back to rate this after I make it again using all the posted ingredients. Really yummy, I need to add the nutmeg and see what that does to the flavor."
158966,79222,10/20/2010,5,10/18/10 Update. I have to rave again about this recipe. I took the extra time to fry up some bacon and carmelize the onions in the renderings and still added the Old Bay and used the Cajun Seasoning in liu of the cayenne pepper. There were 5 people at the table but I expanded the recipe to feed 9.  I'm glad I did since nearly everyone had seconds. Even my super picky kid likes this!! ****************** 12/22/08: Absolutely fabulous!  This is  so easy to make and oh so satisfying.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay and used Cajun seasoning blend in place of the cayenne.  My nine year old son loved it.  Next time I will try adding some bacon like some of the other reviewers have done.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks ever so much for sharing.
827374,79222,11/29/2010,3,"We made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I just used canned crab meat and honestly, it didn't really seem to add much flavor to the soup. But really, this can easily just be a chunky potato soup and would be nice and tasty.  I added about 1/2 a cup of thinly sliced carrots and 1/2 a cup of peas which added some nice color, texture and flavor to things.  In addition to the listed seasonings, I used 5 Pepper Seasoning and a few dashes of Italian Seasoning to add some flavor.   Also used 12 oz. of crab and 4 c. of potatoes and added about 1/2 of a cup both broth and milk to compensate for the added volume.  Came out with a nice thickness and is a stick-to-your-ribs kinda meal."
1719774,79222,12/16/2010,5,"This was pretty good.  I could tell that my husband loved it.  Mine was spicy.  I think I added more cayenne and ground pepper than was necessary.  Also, I used pepper from a grinder instead of already ground.  I also used frozen corn instead of creamed, added more flour/cornstarch, and didn't have the nutmeg, so I didn't use it.  Thanks for the recipe."
49304,180132,2/13/2007,5,Delicious easy to make soup which we really enjoyed. Cut the recipe in half & made it just like the recipe stated. This worked really good for our low fat/ low carb diet. I will defintely be making this soup often. Thank you for posting the recipe.
152118,79222,1/2/2011,5,I enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was using frozen corn instead of creamed and vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  I also added about 1/4 cup chopped shrimp since I had some in the fridge and a splash of half and half at the end.  A bit of salt as well. Yummy.
1781977,79222,1/15/2011,4,"Very good base with many options.  First time I added lump crab.  Today went straight vegetarian and sauteed tiny diced zucchini, carrots, sweet red pepper along with the listed veggies (onion, garlic, potato); very colorful and nutritious.  Both times I also added additional sweet frozen corn for a little crunch and sweetness.  Loved the nutmeg. Both times I made this chowder I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and also added 1-2 TBSP of  sherry at the very end.  Very nice combination of flavors and textures.  As stated a above, a good base with limitless combinations of broths/stocks, dairy/soy, seafoods, shredded chicken, etc."
1874846,79222,4/4/2011,0,"FABULOUS!<br/><br/>I could not afford any of the ingredients, so I just used what I had in my kitchen and that is the creamed corn. I warmed it up on medium heat for a few minutes and pretended that I was eating the Potato-Crab Chowder. UNBELIEVABLE! Thanks for this recipe."
1631574,79222,12/3/2012,5,This is an excellent recipe for crab chowder. I followed the recipe with only a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper along with the black pepper. I also added about 1/4 cup of sherry at the end of cooking time. We loved it!
1802624639,79222,3/30/2014,5,"I like the nutmeg better than I expected. I did make a few changes. Added cayenne and used fresh crab meat (that I caught the day before). I also couldn&#039;t see making this without celery, so I added celery. One tip, cook this chowder a day in advance and let it set in the fridge overnight. Like most soups, stews and chowders, it&#039;s much better on day two."
1802697284,79222,11/16/2014,0,Awesome chowder! I used both canned and imitation crab. The second added a lot of flavor. I added Old Bay Seasoning as well. Truly yummy!
2002097693,79222,4/5/2018,0,Do you have cook the potatoes beforehand?
337963,87750,9/19/2006,4,"The pepper and allspice, along using bacon grease to grease the pan, made this a very flavorful cornbread.  We enjoyed it!"
226081,127155,6/29/2005,5,"this is my recipe from my website, www.finedinings.com"
185285,127155,8/11/2005,5,"This recipe contained ingredients I knew I liked, in a combonation I wasn't sure of. *Trust me*, if you typically enjoy the bleu cheese, basil & crab - THIS is a your appetizer.  DH, who is very finicky about 'weird' combos adored this dish.  Hint: If you love basil, resist being generous as it competes with the bleu cheese - and that is the base flavor.  I spinkled bleu cheese ontop before baking as well.  This is a great appetizer - thanks for sharing!!"
180087,127155,1/31/2006,5,"Great recipe.  We did use canned  crab, it was excellent.  Made the stuffing a day ahead.  We used med to small white mushroom, and found there was more stuffing than needed.  Crab around here is kind of $$$, so we will probably just make the bread crumb, bacon, & cheese stuffing next time, as we were just as satisfied with them.  Thanks for the recipe, the directions were very clear and it made for nice company appetizers."
240552,127155,3/3/2008,5,"What a wonderful delicious lunch! I made the filling and put it in a portabella.  I used my own bread crumbs, light cheese, Franks Red Hot sauce as I didn't have tobasco so used more, and imitation crab meat as that is what I had on hand.  I ate the whole thing and am quite full!! LOL!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
446143,127155,6/24/2008,5,"DH liked these a lot  Also used the filling in a large portabella cap.  I used an Italian cheese blend and added some mayo to the mixture, and melted some cheese on top too.  Skipped the egg and the wine, and used canned lump crabmeat.  Thanks!"
805572,127155,6/12/2010,5,"The best stuffed mushrooms ever..fresh crab is a must, yummy!!  I will definitely make again, thanks for the great recipe =-)"
1802811100,127155,6/9/2014,5,"These were a big hit at a recent party, and they went like hotcakes!  I didn&#039;t have fresh crab, but the canned crab worked.  They were still good, but I&#039;ll bet they&#039;ll be delicious with the fresh crab.  Either way, a big hit!"
263525,145160,11/17/2005,5,This was really great! It turned out to be really savory.  I made a few adjustments to the amout but it was delicious. Thanks!
58439,180132,6/9/2007,4,"GREAT hearty chicken soup"
628951,180132,11/13/2007,5,Very good and tasty especially when your craving soup on a low carb diet.
2854176,180132,6/7/2013,5,"The best chicken and vegetable I have made! It&#039;s easy, very yummy and low in calories. Thank you!"
101732,180705,11/5/2008,5,You're right...it's good!! The kids loved it! (So did I) I used lean ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Thanks so much for postng! Made for My 3 Chef's '08.
52476,181765,8/15/2006,5,"We have been eating this bbq sauce for years!  Fortunately for me I live in Northern Alabama and have access to the restaurant that originated the white bbq sauce (Big Bob Gibson's). It's my understanding that this white sauce is indicative only to Northern Alabama. The only way I have ever seen it eaten or have eaten it myself is with ""smoked"" chicken (either poured over the chicken after its done or used as a dipping sauce).  The combination of the smoked chicken and the tartness of the sauce is heavenly! I make this often in the Summer months and encourage everyone to give it a try!!  "
37722,181765,3/12/2007,5,"This is excellent and the same recipe I've always used except that we increased the amt. of pepper slightly, and added a little sugar and salt to boot. Never tried the red pepper but will. I lived for 34 years in Huntsville, AL before moving to St. Louis, and our favorite place to have white BBQ sauce was the old Greenbrier restaurant on Hwy 20. There we douse grilled chicken with the sauce, but a major treat is their heavenly hushpuppies, to which we also add the white sauce. I grill skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts pre-seasoned only with seasoned salt and serve the white sauce on the side when serving. And Sally's right: the sauce tastes a whole lot better after chilling for a few days. Finally, don't buy commercially bottled white BBQ sauce; it's usually awful. Thanks, Sally!"
135470,181765,5/5/2008,1,I did not care for this at all. All I could taste was the vinegar.
296027,182985,5/19/2007,4,"Very nice,fresh summertime martini.  I will make this again tonight and update my response,leaving out the triple sec and Chambord as an alternative method for myself. I think I really like the taste of watermelon, so I felt the other two might have detracted from the flavor I was anticipating.  Triplesec and Chambord aren't my favorite flavors,so that part may just be me - others should make it as written and determine for themselves how they like it.  I LOVED the icy almost slushines I got from shaking the frozen watermelon too (DH helpd to be sure I was vigorous enough!!)....SOOO fabulous and PINK!!! ;)  Will be making again,in 2 weeks when my friend comes in town! Great recipe addition,Lazyme - thank you!!!"
82616,195132,11/16/2006,5,"Ok, I made this last night durng one of my baking spree moments. part of it is froze and the other is GONE!!! This is a wonderful cake, great taste. I made no changes. Thanks lorrie :)"
92816,195132,12/3/2006,5,This definately deserves 5 stars.I have made various Cherry Cakes and loaves over the years but this one is the best.I love the top on this.I didn't use any icing sugar but just the nice crispy top is so tasty.I also used baking cherries not maraschino.I'll be making this one every Christmas.Thanks for posting it.
593513,195132,11/19/2010,5,I did write a review for this cake but it seems to of disappeared along with my private notes. I just noticed it because I was going to make it again this weekend. Must of went into that land far far away !!!!!   I found these very moist and delicious cakes. I had made 3 mini bundt cakes and 3 mini loaf pans. They turned out so good. At the time I didn't have the almond extract so I had used vanilla paste. This is definitely a recipe worth more than 5 stars.
1651233,195132,11/14/2011,5,Made this cake this morning and it is so good! This recipe will definitely be a part of my Christmas line up. I made it in two loaf pans and they came out beautifully! I think next time I will replace the cherries with gumdrops and see how that goes. Thanks Lorrie!
9580,208980,2/5/2007,5,"I saw this on 30 Minute Meals too! This sandwich is amazing!  It is so good.  I omitted adding olive oil to the meatball mixture and the results were fine."
462571,208980,7/5/2007,5,"These were a snap to whip up and were fantastic! I grilled the meatballs on the BBQ, setting them in a grill pan. I served the subs open-faced rather than topping with the other half bun. These made even tastier leftovers!! Thanks for posting!"
376098,208980,8/1/2007,5,This was great! My husband said it tasted just like a chicken parm on a bun without me even telling him the name of the recipe!  We will make this again.
222139,208980,9/8/2007,5,I chose this recipe from Fall Pick A Chef.  Could not have picked out a better one.  Great lunch dinner meal.  Because I made so much I will be freezing the chicken for later use.  Thanks for posting this recipe for us to try.
674484,208980,9/15/2008,5,"Since this is one of my favorites subs, I decided to try making my own instead of going to the sub shop.  I REALLY LOVED this!  I put mine on the rolls, then added the cheese, put in the oven until cheese melted and the roll was toasted and crunchy.  What a great sandwich Jess!"
1251627,208980,6/23/2009,5,"This recipie was so great, the kids loved it. I've also made it with chicken breast on a whole wheat roll for a healthy family dinner."
456221,208980,2/20/2010,5,"This is a favorite here, too-- have made it several times.  This is also good served over pasta."
229619,208980,6/26/2011,5,I was flipping through one of Rachael Ray's cookbooks and this recipe caught my eye so I checked and sure enough it was already posted here. I did use ground turkey instead of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  It was a hit here and I'll definitely be making it again.
280271,219118,11/9/2008,4,This is so yummy. Quick to prepare and can simmer on the stove while you fix the rest of your dinner. It has a nice sweet taste that is not overpowering. Just right. We really enjoyed it. I served it with recipe #211485 and a baked potato. Thanks for posting. :)
305531,219118,12/17/2008,4,Really good carrots! There were a great side dish to go along with some grilled salmon and rice. Thanks carolinafan. Made for I Recommend Tag.
1320855,228530,7/12/2009,5,"I found this recipe by searching for healthy Indian foods. I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but I LOVED it. I was almost like candy, but for dinner and incredibly healthy. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable, used 1 1/3 cups canned pumpkin,  chicken broth because I didn't have vegetable, sweet curry powder instead of the regular spicy kind, and the first time I made it I accidentally used ground white pepper (which has a sort of white-wine taste) and it tasted so good I used it the second time. This is a definite new regular meal. Thanks so much for sharing, I absolutely love it, especially the pumpkin-onion combination (which I'd never thought of before). One thing for anyone else trying this: my parents and sister hated it, but they are not pumpkin fans like I am. I personally don't think it tastes SUPER pumpkin-y, but that's just me. Try it out and see how you like it. I was really surprised to find that I was the only one who liked it, because it tastes like heaven to me."
345569,228530,10/5/2009,5,"The last time I tried a bulgur / pumpkin combination, I was disappointed -- even though I like both ingredients -- so I was wary of trying this recipe.  But I am so glad I did, because it was wonderful!  I skipped the oil altogether and didn't miss it.  I also used a buttercup squash instead of pumpkin, and crushed bay leaves since that was all I had; and consomme instead of the vegetable broth.  The curry powder lent such a pretty color to the dish but the flavor wasn't at all overpowering.  Thanks for posting!"
278578,228530,10/3/2010,5,"This is great, my first time really cooking with pumpkin. I subbed quinoa for bulgur and let it cook dry for a few extra minutes before adding the water (I didn't have stock). I added just a little maple syrup because it just seemed to be asking for it. Would make this again, thanks!"
1660185,246902,1/30/2011,5,"Good flavor and my HS and MS kids ate it with no question! Probably better in the Summer sea on to have some great, fresh veggies with this.  Made mashed potatoes and green beans! Will do this easy, good recipe again!"
22174,342209,12/28/2008,4,I am changing my initial review because they got better overnight! At first they seemed a bit blah but I just had one and the sweetness and flavor have improved greatly. Other great thing is these were simple and I had everything on hand! Thank you!
437991,342209,5/25/2009,5,"What a nice change to the banana bread i used to make with too ripe bananas! The bananas were so sweet i  only used a little sugar and shredded cocnuts. Thank you for sharing, made for ZWT5"
423539,342209,6/2/2009,5,"These are lovely cookies not bland at all."
1183623,342209,10/28/2009,5,"so good!  i used applesauce in place of the butter/shortening and added extra vanilla instead of lemon juice, and 2 cups of oats just to thicken the batter up a little, and they turned out perfect.  i just wanted something different for lunch snacks and these seem to be a hit!"
495793,342209,12/21/2009,3,"These were just so-so.  I agree with another reviewer that they got better overnight.  I was looking for a use of ripe bananas (instead of my usual banana bread) and I thought these would be great.  They are missing something.  The texture is okay, but I think they need some cinnamon or a little brown sugar or molasses, they were just a bit bland.  I think these good be very good with some work on the ""seasoning"".  Thanks for posting."
444132,342209,2/17/2010,4,"These were wonderful cookies - I'm rating as a 4 instead of a 5, just because I think you need to make sure the batter is a little thicker, or they'll come out a thin and spread more than expected.  I love the flavour, and I did add 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips and the nuts used were walnuts.  I used butter, too, so next time I'll try shortening (or 1/2 and 1/2) and up the oats/flour if needed.  I think once you make these a couple of times and get the consistency down, they'd be the best thing in the cookie jar!  Made for Zaar Stars - thanks, iewe!!!"
669019,342209,5/19/2010,4,"They're like banana bread, in cookie form. I added nutmeg - they would also be good with cinnamon and brown sugar."
678366,342209,6/19/2010,5,We enjoyed these cookies and it was a great way to use the brown bananas. A little cinnamon is also a good addition. Made for ZWT6 and were decorated by DD.
522099,424415,5/21/2010,5,"I really didn't expect to like this rice as much as I did.  It smelled wonderful while it cooked and tasted good by itself.  But what really brought it to 5 stars is the way it supported and elevated the dahl and mushroom dishes I served it with.  A wonderful complement to any Indian dish.  And the leftovers would make a BANGIN' rice pudding. Made for Looney Spoons ZWT6"
171790,424415,5/22/2010,4,What a wonderful aroma while cooking. Dinner guests rated this from 3 stars(diner prefers plain rice) to 5 stars. I've averaged the ratings. Made for ZWT6.
491979,424415,5/24/2010,5,Perfect rice. We love Basmati RiceMade for ZWT 6  for Queens of Quisine
724516,424415,6/22/2010,5,"Well I got perfect rice also, I served this with recipe#392938#392938 and the two went very well together. I kind of crushed my cardamom a bit to let the flavour out, you could really taste the two spices. A very nice recipe. Thank you for posting. Made for ZWT#6 2010."
480195,424415,6/25/2010,5,The rice turned out perfectly and had good flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
852554,424415,8/23/2012,5,This was great rice and I loved that it was made in my rice cooker!  I subbed about half the water with coconut milk as I had some leftover from another recipe. Made for ZWT 8
422608,441096,2/26/2016,5,"I didn&#039;t follow the instructions exactly, but it came out awesome! Oh and my husband has no clue I put pumpkin in it. He can&#039;t wait to eat it again tonight!"
230860,442352,1/9/2011,5,"These were very good.  Maybe my sourdough loaf was small, but I got 4 sandwiches out of this using the stated amounts for each ingredient.  I really liked the crust on the outside of the bread and the kick from the red pepper.  I also really enjoyed the flavors of the turkey, muenster, avocado and cilantro together."
1232945,487707,10/8/2012,0,"Loved this salsa flavored meatloaf...tang is a nice touch, and so healthy:)"
27378,21531,3/8/2002,5,This is also known as noodle kugle. I love it. It is one of my favorites.
35555,21531,3/20/2002,1,"I found this pudding, extremely discusting.  It was way to rich for my taste buds, and it's texture was not one to my liking. Yuck!"
89210,33486,6/8/2003,4,This is pretty good !! I used frozen spinach :( probably won't do that again ! next time I'm considering sour creme and poppyseeds too
227666,36144,11/4/2005,4,"I halved this recipe, and it turned out pretty good, except for maybe a little too much vanilla extract for my taste. I might be making again for one of those warm, summer nights. :]"
53932,36144,7/16/2006,5,"I also halved the recipe and not reading it carefully, used vanilla yogurt rather than plain.  I love vanilla so with the addition of even more, I liked this!  Perfect treat for a hot summer day."
442988,36144,5/30/2007,3,"I'm sorry I couldn't give this a higher rating ... I appreciated the fact that this could be made so that it's virtually nonfat.  But I thought there was too much gelatin in it -- in fact, when I tried to pour the base mixture into the ice cream freezer, it had already solidified into a gelatinous, mass.  (I used Trader Joe's plain nonfat yogurt).  I'll keep looking for my platonic ideal of vanilla frozen yogurt -- but thanks for posting this!"
490060,36144,6/22/2007,5,"i have had no problem with the gelatin, as another user has posted.  I have only had good results, the most fluffy, light, dreamy, creamy frozen yogurt I have ever made. DEFINITELY the best vanilla frozen yogurt I have had."
447165,36144,8/28/2007,5,I halved this (except the vanilla- oops!) for my Cuisinart icecream maker as a couple others did-- great stuff!  We are excited to try it tomorrow after it's ripened too because the super-frozen parts left in the bowl were the best we thought.  We didn't find we needed to chill the mixture after adding the yogurt and vanilla because the yogurt came straight from the fridge.  I love that this is low fat and the gelatin insead of eggs which make me nervous to use uncooked.  Thanks Tom!
464253,36144,5/6/2008,4,"On the first night, the yogurt was a great consistency, creamy and fluffy. Unfortunately, it got pretty hard and icy after sitting in the freezer overnight. Better than other recipes I've tried in that regard and maybe it just can't be avoided with home made. Definitely try this, it's delicious!"
176615,36144,6/10/2008,5,"Excellent! Light, fluffy, and creamy, not icy like homemade lowfat frozen desserts tend to be. I halved the recipe and used the Cusinart ice cream maker. So easy and so healthy, I'll be making this often. Highly suggest Stonyfield Farm or other plain organic yogurt as the flavor and quality is so much better, in my opinion, than regular commercial varieties. Thanks for sharing your recipe! UPDATE: I make this often and especially like using Stonyfield's vanilla yogurt and serving with fresh sliced strawberries or other berries. Also LOVE this with a drizzle of local honey. Yum. To die for!"
1108690,36144,1/2/2009,1,"What a disastrous recipe.  We used fat free yogurt instead of low fat yogurt which could have been the problem, but our concoction was anything but frozen yogurt.  It took a long time for it to finally become a consistency other than regular yogurt.  When it finally did harden, it was like eating flakes of sorbet. Very disappointing.  We will never use this recipe again.  However, we still are looking for a good fat free frozen yogurt recipe, if anyone has any suggestions.  But please, don't make the same mistake we did by using this unsuccessful recipe."
960426,36144,12/16/2009,4,"Just to comment on Chef #1108690 's review.  There's no telling how much more gelatin you added to this recipe that was called for by using non-fat yogurt. That's how they make fat-free yogurt stand up without any fat.   That accounts for your flakes.  Delicious animal-bone-collagen flakes."
1320105,36144,5/14/2010,2,None of my kids liked this at all.  It still had a bitter taste like yogurt normally does.  Nothing like the frozen yogurt from the stores.
386585,278406,9/29/2008,5,"This is a great variation on the classic Reuben sandwich.  Instead of the tartness of sauerkraut, the sweet and tangy cole slaw mixture was a nice change.  It is also really easy to make, and I will definitely be having this again (and without the guilt of a regular Reuben)!  Thanks for posting, 2Bleu.  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game."
2001891832,183729,4/30/2018,0,There is no cooking temp?????? Love this recipe so I will assume it is 350?????
1202739,36144,9/12/2010,5,"I am AMAZED at the people who DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE, but chose to give it one to three stars.  The recipe calls for LOW FAT yogurt, not non-fat.  Another review makes the point that the reason non-fat yogurt is gelatinous is because of GELATIN!  The recipe was formulated for low-fat yogurt.  I make lots of substitutions in recipes, but I would never PRESUME to rate a recipe for not turning out well when I did not follow the directions.<br/><br/>I thought this recipe turned out very well.  As another reviewer, I halved the recipe because I only had a 32 oz tub of yogurt and was a cup short for the full recipe.  I used low-fat Vanilla yogurt and Splenda instead of sugar.  I also agree with another reviewer that it can go straight in the ice cream maker after incorporating the yogurt and vanilla.<br/><br/>This is very light and refreshing.  My husband and I like intense vanilla flavor, and by using vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract it was quite tasty.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think next time I may chunk up some fresh pineapple to drop in as well - I think the tartness of the pineapple would go well with the yogurt.  Cheers!"
12657,45119,7/30/2003,3,"The instructions in this recipe are very lucid and easy to follow, but the end result was a little drier than I had hoped. The combination of ingredients worked well but it lacked the 'juice' that perhaps a chopped tomato could have provided. I topped this with a good amount of plain yogurt before serving and that did make it less dry. Thanks for posting, Karyl."
74736,45119,3/26/2004,5,"Thought this was delicious Karyl, it's nice to know sweet potatos CAN be made without brown sugar or marshmellows! This recipe almost reminded me of some smothered hashbrowns we had that were enjoyed all around, only a lot less greasy:)"
1802694935,45119,11/27/2014,5,I found this to be a very good take off on sweet potatos.  The use of olive oil was a good addition to this recipe that really made the difference.  The sweet peppers were also a plus.  For something different.  Go this one!!!
56112,58758,4/18/2003,4,"Real good recipe.  Will definately make this again.  I probably will not add quite as much sugar to the next batch.  This one was just a little too sweet for my taste.  For those who like their coffee really sweet, it will be just perfect the way it is.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
29621,58758,7/31/2004,5,"Thanks for the great recipe!"
537179,58758,11/21/2008,4,Nice recipe! I scaled this down for 2. Was nice and easy. Great taste.
583401,138839,9/5/2011,5,"This was delicious. I used butter instead of margarine which probably added a lot more fat then necessary.. but these are for my brother who needs the extra calories. Easy, fast, and tasty."
326970,161899,10/27/2006,5,"I made this Jambalaya and we all loved it.  I didn't add all the cayenne pepper at once as DH isn't nuts about hot'n'spicy.  Used regular frozen corn rather than baby corn chopped.  Excellent.  My crock pot was too small so finished on the stove top.  Next time I make it, I'll cut it in half."
320245,181439,9/29/2006,5,"Amazing - I always love your recipes, kittencal! I cook for very large groups on a very small budget, so in lieu of the zucchini I just added several cans of corn. Also (I'm in Switzerland), since cheddar cheese is expensive, I subsituted Fontal cheese in the dumplings and added quite a bit more cayenne than it called for. It was a hit! Thanks so much for all of your great cooking ideas!"
44642,190875,10/19/2006,0,"Just posting, so I will know I tryed this. Never have found one of his recipes that I like. Did not make the polenta."
162191,190875,10/20/2006,5,I loved this recipe.
137302,224025,4/18/2012,2,This is probably one of those toppings which has to become an acquired taste.  It seemed to have an off taste to me that may have come from the cornstarch.  Honey is thick on it's own when cooled slightly and I think that if someone wanted their honey and butter mixed they would do better to just mix and heat them without the cornstarch.  Made for PAC Spring 2012
238496,254859,10/4/2007,4,Delicious and fresh are the words I would choose for this recipe. I gave four stars because I like very spicy food. This is a personal observation only and not a critiscim of this recipe. I recommend it. My changes were to add a habenero chili as well. I sauted it over a low flame for 5-6 minutes. This kicks up the heat factor. Thank you lilchris for a great recipe.
424680,256416,11/2/2009,5,"Made this with raw apple cider & my last bag of frozen cranberries! I used a generous tablespoon of minced orange zest ~ Very nice tasting sauce, although another time I want to try it mixed with a pint or so of homemade chunky applesauce! [Tagged, made & reviewed as part of my Sassy Sauces! theme in the current My 3 Chefs event]"
27443,278406,1/15/2008,5,"If you like Reubens this is a must to try!  I can not say enough about this sandwich. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I made it as an open face, thus eliminating the calories etc of 1 slice of bread. Thanks for sharing your revision."
803511,278406,6/26/2009,5,"Great Reuben variation!  I liked making the coleslaw/sauerkraut myself.  I added an extra handful of cabbage into the pot because it was cooking down so much it didn't look like enough for two sandwiches.  When I put the sandwiches together I only ended up using about 2/3 of the meat and 1/2 the cheese called for.  I shredded cheese off a block instead of using slices.  Lastly, I just can't give up my usual Reuben sauce (mayo, chili sauce, horseradish) so we subbed that for the mayo/mustard suggested in your recipe.  I think overall using less cheese and meat brought this ""lighter"" Reuben down even farther!  Made for PRMR Tag Game."
222564,294427,10/25/2012,5,"Great, well balanced, sweet and savory, crispy salad with fruity apple cider vinaigrette. I was tempted to substitute apple juice concentrate to the apple cider to it's reduced quantity, but restrained myself and kept to the recipe."
222478,414099,5/1/2010,5,"Very tasty! One thing I couldn't bring myself to do was combine the melted butter with the breadcrumbs because I think it would have made it too hard to coat the scallops evenly, instead I melted the butter along with the garlic and tossed the mix around with the scallops, then dipped in the breadcrumbs. It was much enjoyed over a bed of couscous."
780172,414099,7/3/2013,5,This is a super easy dish to prepare. I felt it lacked a little seasoning so added a little Old Bay Seasoning. I got to use parsley from my garden. Nice way to make scallops.
1609258,443932,9/13/2011,4,"Good but garlicy.  It didn't really have that umami taste that real boursin has but it is still good as a dip or a spread.  It gets better with age so don't judge based on how it taste straight out of the food processor.  I couldn't find the umeboshi plum paste but I did find some pickled umeboshi pickled plums that I tossed into the food processor with everything else.  If you can't find the plums, I think a good sub would be miso paste."
364211,463367,9/7/2011,5,"WOW! What a sandwich. Loved, loved, loved the sauce. I did not expect this to be so good.  I would give this an 8 star rating if I could.  I used thin sliced whole wheat bread that I keep in the freezer because I don't use bread a lot.  Purchased the meat and cheese especially for this sandwich, except I made a mistake and ordered provolone instead of swiss.  I used a dill pickle relish that I already had and put a thin layer on the sandwich.  Next time I will make with the swiss cheese.  gailanng, thanks so much for posting"
4470,27551,10/17/2002,4,"This is a very tasty recipe with a different veggie combination.  Easy to put together and great flavor..  The recipe had more bread crumbs in it than I used.  I think this would  be very tasty but I wanted to cut back on the crumbs and Olive oil. Thanks Kari for a lovely addition to my cookbook.  This is a 5 star recipe but because of the changes I made to it I rated it a 4 star."
22898,27551,11/29/2002,4,I followed Bergy's quantities for this recipe so I can't give it a 5 but it is delicious and I will usee it again.  I do agree with Bergy that it is a 5.
873573,27551,12/29/2009,5,"I love the idea of mixing artichokes with green bean casserole!  I made this recipe for my Christmas Eve dinner when I found out that twice as many people were coming and I didn't have enough food prepared.  This is quick and easy and tasted great!  I didn't have any breadcrumbs so I mixed in a little cram of mushroom soup to keep it glued, but I will definitely try again with the bread crumbs.  Nice play on the traditional casserole! =)"
68460,56494,5/3/2003,5,"These cakes couldn't be quicker, easier and more delicious if they tried.  I used 1 pound of cleaned and deveined shrimp, then all of the rest of the ingredients exactly.  The sweet chilli sauce has the perfect amount of sweet and hot to it to give these wonderful cakes just the right tang.  My husband and I polished off half the batch as quickly as they came out of the frying pan!  We just LOVE these and I'll be making them again and again.  Thanks so much KitchenManiac...these are terrific!"
182292,56494,12/23/2004,5,"Agreed: quick, easy, delicious. An entire platter vanished into a very picky Christmas party crowd, who all looked around for more. And that you can freeze the raw patties for quick cooking later is a huge plus. We substituted shrimp for the prawns, lime zest and juice for the leaves, used pre-crushed cornflakes (guessing that 2 c. of flakes crushes down to about 1/4 c. of crumbs). We also tried two sorts of Thai sweet chili sauce...one very sweet and mild, one very spicy. I advise using the spicy one in the prawn cake recipe and then serving with the mild one for dipping."
10033,56494,7/8/2007,5,"Excellent recipe, loved by all. I had a hard time finding lime leaves in the amount of time I had to shop (I know where I could find them for sure but couldn't get over there before dinner), so I just left htem out, and the flavor was still very good. Thanks so much for posting."
82616,63426,11/20/2006,5,"I made this up for Thanksgiving gifts. What a wonderful treat. Great mixture of sweet and salty, and I love the sympbolism of each item. This truly is a great ""gift"". Thanks"
125388,63426,11/25/2006,5,"Wonderful idea for Thanksgiving!  I made these in Wilton plastic disposable decorating bags (to resemble a cornucopia).  I printed the blessing on the computer and stapled it to the top of each bag.  I placed one on the top of each plate on the Thanksgiving table.  We read this blessing as our prayer before dinner.  Everyone young and old alike, loved it!  I made 12 of these, and added each ingredient individually to the bags to make sure each bag got some of each ingredient."
35488,63426,11/27/2008,5,"Thanks, NovaLee - I was having a hard Thanksgiving today, and came across this recipe.  Will make and give it with thanks for many Thanksgivings to come!"
262312,102025,6/15/2009,5,"these were great!!  love finding new meatball recipes!  made as written but added garlic powder, parmesan cheese and used heavy cream instead of milk.  oh, and i added an egg. made up ahead of time and had chilling in fridge til i was ready for them.  thanks for a great meatball recipe!  will add to my keeper collection!"
4470,115534,4/26/2006,4, Lovely flavor - I enjoy Adobo spice. Instead of scallions I used 1/4 sweet onion (just for flavor).  I found it a bit dry so I added 2 tbsp Ketjap Benteng (An Indonisian sauce) I like my peppers  crisp so added them for the last 5 min only . Instead of regular noodles I used Whole Wheat. Delicious dinner thanks Chef Christine
107135,116953,4/14/2005,5,this is a nice recipe to have if you make alot of muffins like i do  i love your muffin recipes dee
209441,116953,5/12/2005,5,"What a fantastic mix! I made up a recipe of this and stuck it in my freezer to use for recipes like muffins and cakes, brilliant idea KITTENCAL! and really great streusel too!"
52543,116953,5/12/2005,5,"I usually have a batch of Healthy Bran Muffin mix (#114718) in my fridge; I now have a batch of your streusel mix in my freezer. These 2 mixes will be perfect mates for a quick, easy, tasty breakfast or snack. As usual, I used pecans instead of yucky walnuts. Thanx Kitten!"
235751,116953,8/28/2005,5,"What a great idea and recipe! It would be a real time-saver when making muffins, coffee cakes, sweet potato casseroles, etc.  Thanks so much for posting - you've done it again, Kittencal."
86318,158118,3/23/2013,5,"These noodles are wonderful! I did halve the recipe, and used snow pea shoots instead of gai lan. I also used shimeji mushrooms for oyster mushrooms, and dried rice noodles instead of fresh. The recipe doesn&#039;t list chicken stock in the ingredients, although it is in the directions. I used 1 3/4 cup stock for my half batch (though more might be better). It took longer than I expected for the dried noodles to cook, so I ended up cooking them separately, and putting the sauce over them in the bowl. Also, I don&#039;t know so much about cooking with black beans. I soaked mine in hot water, and then chopped them before adding them to the pan. It didn&#039;t seem to hurt. Thank you very very much for this delicious recipe."
397462,195977,9/25/2008,5,"I made this a few days ago, it is one of the quickest dessert recipes I' ve found. My son who is my food critic loves this and has asked me to make another one. I made no changes but next time I won't bake it quite as long."
328099,195977,10/5/2008,5,"Have had several gooey butter cakes while visiting our kids in St. Louis.  When I found this recipe, I was really excited--made it this past weekend when the St. Louis family was home--what a fabulous treat.  This will be made for many occasions in the future.  Thank you,"
403193,195977,10/27/2008,5,WOW OMGosh !  nmlawrence Thank you We love this cake.  I have made this cake for years but in our resent move I misplaced it.  So I came to Recipe Zar.  For help to just make sure I didnâ€™t mess up.  These instructions are so well written and I think that the one thing that I never did is the secret trick to Perfect Ooie Gooie Butter Cake and that is melting the butter.  Thank you for posting and making my Gooie Gooieâ€™er  and my Butter Cake better.  Lori
61995,195977,10/28/2008,5,"I have been making this for more than 10 years!  Mine is called ""Neiman Marcus butter cake, since it is so rich!  I use a 13 x 9 x 2 inch glass pan and have never had it spill over!  You can easily chance the flavor by changing the type of cake mix and extract!  I remember someone changing hers to Lemon and it went over very well!  I love it at room temp or slightly warm!  And cut it in tiny pieces!  People can take more than one!  I usually leave it in the pan and let people cut it themselves!  This is one of my top favorite recipes!"
440735,195977,12/25/2009,5,I am from St. Louis and have grown up on Gooey Butter Cakes! This has got to be one of the best recipes for this.  I think the vanilla is the magic to it. This is a very sweet cake. I only put 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Next time I will only use three.  I did use a 9x13 and placed it on a cookie sheet. It took much longer to cook as I expected but wanted to try it.  I took it out when it was golden brown.  I would agree with letting it completely cool.  Enjoy!
633027,195977,12/29/2009,5,"My husband and I lived in (and loved) St. Louis for several years before moving to central Texas.  The food is one of the things we miss most about STL.  My husband decided he wanted to make gooey butter cake for our Christmas dessert, and since he couldn't find the recipe he's used in the past, he chose this one to try.  He followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  It's very sweet, melt-in-your-mouth gooey, and certainly addictive.  The directions were very clear and detailed.  Bake time for our oven was 40 minutes; we served it at room temperature.  We look forward to making it again soon.  Thank you SO much for posting this St. Louis treat!!!!"
543968,195977,4/21/2010,5,"WOW!!! This is so very very very good!"
2100189,195977,12/12/2011,5,"This is the same recipe that I used in St. Louis about 35 years ago, at age 10. :-) I am from Affton/Kirkwood/Glendale area & now reside in SE Florida. I lost my recipe & am thankful that you posted. Today I made small tartlets with this recipe & put almond filling & cherry pie filling in the bottom, spooned the cheese mix over the top & added sliced almonds. Baking time is about 20 minutes or so, depending on your oven. I also used Mexican vanilla. It is a great vanilla for baking use. The aluminum cupcake cups with the wax paper liners work great for sharing, once the tartlet is removed from the tartlet pans. I topped off with powdered sugar. The ladies @ the Cookie Exchange party I made them for were all a buzz with curiousity & they went like lightning. This is an excellent recipe and is really easy to make."
1701315,195977,3/25/2012,5,"I grew up in Southern MO, but we often drove up to STL and would get fed Gooey Butter Cakes by our hosts.  I have tried far more complicated and time consuming recipes for them, and this easiest of versions has to take the cake...pun intended.  Wonderfully sweet and gooey with that most amazing phenomenon one calls a sugar crust.  Thanks for bringing back fond childhood memories!"
1351584,195977,7/2/2012,5,"Delicious! But kinda on the sweet side. Instead of 4 cups confectioners sugar, I just put 2. Still tastes great. Just less sweeter. My kids love it"
7248862,195977,12/5/2013,5,THIS recipe was the reason I joined this site! I too am from St. Louis and this recipe (as is) takes me back home. Will try other variations...15 STARS...GREAT recipe
2001338551,195977,4/4/2017,0,Have made this cake often. Have added 1 1/2 c of mashed sweet potatoes to filling mixture with tsp of cinnamon. Changes flavor totally.
492343,234171,12/13/2007,5,Yummy
1802406495,195977,1/25/2014,0,"To everyone reading this. There is no such thing as St Louis Gooey Buttercake. Buttercake or Philadelphia Buttercake as we know, was brought here by the Germans bakers, that came over here. ButterKuchen came from Germany. Many of the German people that settled in and around Philadelphia were great bakers, butchers and candy makers amongst other thing. If you want Buttercake, it exists only around Philadelphia in its true and original form. It started where many of the German immigrants came to live &quot;PHILADELPHIA.&quot;"
1338623,195977,2/4/2014,5,"Gooey Butter Cake is my husbands favorite and since we moved away from St. Louis, he has been craving it. So being the good wife I am, I searched for a recipe, found this one and made it for him. He LOVED it! Super easy to make and since he loved it, saving the recipe to make again and again :)"
91584,195977,3/31/2014,5,Super wonderful recipe! Yum Yum Yum  :)
2000405375,195977,8/15/2015,4,"I followed the (easy) recipe exactly, and it came out real yummy, but I was afraid I&#039;d done something wrong, because it really didn&#039;t rise much at all. It only came up about half way in a 2 inch pan. In comparing to other recipes, I found that other than adding a cup of chocolate chips and a half cup of butter to the topping, &quot;Paula Dean&#039;s Ooey Gooey Chocolate Chip Cake&quot;  is identical, and specifies a 9x13x2 pan. It&#039;s really a cookie dough, which shouldn&#039;t rise much. Omit the needless warning, and I&#039;d give it 5 stars."
2000488445,195977,9/21/2015,4,Wow! This turned out perfectly!! My husband&#039;s been asking me to make a gooey butter cake for a while now and this was wonderful!! We&#039;re from the St Louis area and I try different bakery versions all the time! 2 thumbs up from this household! :)
2000780659,195977,12/27/2015,5,Whoever invented this recipe is a genius. My boyfriend is from Texas and grew up eating this stuff. He talks about it all the time so I made a batch on Christmas. He said it was the best gooey butter cake he&#039;s had. Recipe is super simple and easy to follow.
571722,195977,1/9/2017,1,"This was incredibly sweet, and I reduced the sugar content to 3 cups. I agree it is easy, but if there's a next time I would make it in it's original scratch made recipe, the box cake (though it was a healthier, non-gmo, etc) was just as bad."
2001403242,195977,2/23/2017,0,"I really love St, Louis Gooey Butter cake, but I can only get it when I get to the city. I would love to be able to get it in my hometown. Where is that you ask? Farmington, Missouri it's about 80 miles south of St. Louis. I don't get to travel there but once every 3 to 4 yrs. To go to the hospital for test."
2001719206,195977,9/18/2017,1,This was really terrible. It was overwhelmingly sweet and I used 3 cups of the confectioners instead of 4. And the cake mixture was bizzare. It was grainy and weird. I made it because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand but I wouldn't make again.
803102,195977,10/25/2017,0,"this is the same recipe my mom used 45 years ago, now my husband's co-workers ask him to bring it for the staff pot lucks, you can use other cake mixes to chocolate, spice/add pumpkin to filling and pumpkin spice (that one is my favorite )"
2001782909,195977,11/7/2017,5,"This was so so delicious! Our family enjoyed it so much and was gone in one day! It taste better then gooey butter cake in St. Louis where I live! It was not overly sweet and wasn't to gooey or to overdone! I would recommend refrigerating it, and you HAVE to let it cool!! For ours we had to cook it for about 20-30 minutes longer but, overall this was The Best Gooey Butter Cake that I have ever had!!"
2001861106,195977,12/16/2017,5,"I first learned about gooey cake over 30 years ago while living in Florida. We took a batch with us up to our friends' cabin in the woods. They loved it! When they heard some more of our friends arriving they hid the remaining cake in their chest of drawers so they didn't have to share it! I'll be preparing five cakes this weekend to share with our neighbors. Thirty years is a long time to remember anything, so thank you for the recipe! I'm giving it five stars in advance cause I know it will be awesome!"
2002100759,195977,4/8/2018,1,"I am from Missouri and lived here most of my life and never heard of this until about 3 years ago when I found them for sale in the Deep South. I thought they were of Southern origin. It is correct to claim this as a St. Louis dessert, but saying it represents the entire State of Missouri is pushing it."
43222046,195977,4/10/2018,5,It’s a pretty close. But the 4 cups of powdered sugar was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I’ll leave it at 2 cups and add a bit of lemon juice to the cream cheese filling.
2000551249,195977,7/11/2018,5,We have substituted a lemon cake mix for the yellow cake mix and it is absolutely amazing. This is a go-to recipe to bring a dish parties and bbq's.
2002265401,195977,9/3/2018,2,I will start by saying that I followed the recipe to a T and I’ Sure it came out as expected but baby..... I felt the diabetes coming on after each bite. It tasted great but was just way too sweet. My 9 year old who could eat a bowl of sugar if I allowed it even said it was a “little” too sweet. I honestly would cut the powdered sugar measurement in half. Unfortunately I just dumped the entire lot of what was left after four family members had one serving each. Wow this is sweet.
2001205226,195977,11/3/2018,5,"This is an exceptionally tasty cake! Very sweet, yes - just take a smaller serving. I am a chocoholic, and rarely care for sweets that are not chocolate. This cake is an exception - it is utterly delicious! You will not fully realize this unless you try it!"
450004,241335,9/23/2008,4,"We really enjoyed this! We served it with Greek salad, and icy cold Retsina, from Corinthia! We were going to give it a 5, but thought maybe the sauce could be a little thicker. I will make double the amount of roux next time.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing it! [Made for Fall 08 PAC]"
73746,273416,4/12/2010,5,"I have made these several times now and they are fabulous. This time I ran out of muffin cases so I made a dozen muffins and a cake and both came out lovely"
461897,300405,3/1/2009,5,"The best corn muffins ever! Very soft and sweet. The only thing I added was a touch of honey! I always double the recipe and the muffins fly off the table! Very very good corn muffin, tender and moist!"
242006,300405,8/20/2009,5,"Last night I made cornbread using the recipe on the back of the box.  They changed it, because it was not this recipe.  The new recipe on the box sucks!  Don't make it, make this one!  Trust me, this recipe right here, is the ONLY recipe you'll ever need."
122877,300405,10/13/2009,4,Insomnia struck so I made these this morning.  Simple and quite tasty.  I did add about 2 tbl of honey for a little extra sweetness.
362590,300405,12/2/2009,4,Good recipe. Made them with 1 cup flour and 1 cup cornmeal and added 1/2 cup of raspberries.
250835,300405,1/9/2010,5,"This is awesome stuff!  I used this recipe to make cornbread instead of muffins. Soft, moist and sweet.  Just an FYI due to a previous review: There are two cornbread recipes on the Albers box. One is for regular cornbread and one is for sweet cornbread or muffins. I've made both and THIS recipe is the way to go!  :-)"
857489,300405,2/3/2010,5,"This is the only recipe I've ever used for cornbread. I used to make the Marie Callendar's mix, but not ever again once I tried this! It is awesome, so moist and sweet, like cake. I hate dry, crumbly, tasteless cornbread. I always use the square pan option, I haven't tried the muffins. I highly recommend using the albers cornmeal and this recipe!"
394077,300405,3/21/2011,5,"My goodness these are so good!  I used buttermilk and they are buttery, moist, tender and perfectly sweeten.  I used Alber corn meal as suggested.  Keeper recipe.  Wow."
1879548,300405,5/29/2011,5,"I made the flour and corn meal both 1 cup and soaked my corn meal in the milk first.<br/>I also baked them in a whoopie pie or popover pan for my son - he eats them like the Thomas' toaster cakes, they freeze amazingly well."
1056692,300405,8/25/2011,5,"This is my favorite corn bread recipe!  I'm so glad to find it here already.  I actually had to dig my cornmeal box out of the recycling after moving years ago and cut this recipe off the side because no stores around me carried Albers and other brands didn't have this sweeter recipe on them.  I always put a touch of oil or shortening in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heat it smoking hot while I mix this up so that it sizzles and crisps the outside of the bread when I pour it in, then I put it in the oven.  Great recipe for sweet cornbread."
269198,300405,9/30/2011,5,These are wonderfully tender and sweet! I will never buy Jiffy Mix again because these are so much better. I served them with beans and we will have the leftovers for breakfast.
2000201349,300405,5/13/2015,5,I cut this recipe off the Albers corn meal box years and years ago.  This has been my one and only recipe for almost 40 years.  My sons friends always wanted me to make them when they came out to the farm.  I get more compliments on these then on any other baking.
131126,388283,11/6/2012,5,"Spicy, easy, and good!  I served on a TV night with a tray of oven baked chicken fingers, celery sticks, strips of red peppers, baby carrots, bread sticks, and boiled red potato slices.  It made for nice finger food, literally took minutes to assemble, and satisfied my blue cheese & spicy craving. Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Made for Fall 2012 Pick A Chef."
364211,435357,10/21/2012,5,This does have a nice fresh taste.  I used cracker crumbs on the eggplant slices.  Thanks for posting Chef Curt.  Made for Fall PAC 2012.
2000431901,435357,2/26/2016,4,Nice and easy. I used one big grocery store eggplant. Didn&#039;t soak it overnight and thought it was still tender enough. Added chopped fresh parsley after cooking.
1950221,437309,7/6/2011,5,"Good recipe.  Great crumb and taste.  I halved the recipe which made some measurements difficult, but ended up with 1/4 c. coconut oil, 1/4 t. nutmeg and 2 eggs.  I also used almond milk.  DH liked, so will make again.  Might add some brown sugar for richness next time."
1759365,437309,7/26/2012,4,"I gave this recipe four stars only because i like my muffins just a bit sweeter.  i think i will try it with a little honey or sugar.  other than that, they are light and airy and most of all i used up some of my fresh zucchini out of my garden.  Yum yum!!  i put half in the frig and half in the freezer and my daughter who doesn't have to be glueten free loves them and the fact they are so low in calories.  she sneaks one out of frig or freezer every time she comes over.  so give it a try, if you like it just a tad sweet, then add a little sweetness of some kind.  i will definitely make this recipe again.  thanks"
229448,23259,3/5/2007,4,"This recipe was delightful! Very old world tasting, my husband refused to believe that apples and onion went together but this proved him wrong."
249623,25749,6/14/2009,0,Sounds marvelous!!! I wish I could try this. Maybe after a few more pounds!
313120,135021,9/2/2006,5,Very Good Soup.  Thanks.
158086,135021,5/7/2010,5,This was a very good fast soup...I did not put any ground beef in it and I did not have any tomato juice so I used tomato sauce and watered it down...turned out great...
2060185,135021,11/10/2011,0,I used this recipe to clean use up some foods I had in the freezer. It was great and quite simple. It was very hearty and everyone enjoyed it much!
445492,184649,5/13/2007,5,Great recipe - amazing flavor.  Easy to make too!
89831,225171,5/29/2007,5,"These were buttery rich delicious! I made these in a 13 x 9-inch pan and they baked out well, thank you for sharing Diana!...Kitten:)"
352538,225171,12/1/2010,5,"Love, love these.  The rice flour gives such a nice texture.  Thanks for posting."
222564,225171,12/23/2012,5,"Good, solid basic recipe. Turns out just like on the picture."
39301,44235,9/15/2009,5,This was a huge hit with both of my kids.  Thanks for posting!
726344,281529,1/25/2008,4,Have made these many times  very good
320640,245936,2/26/2010,5,"Delicious! I was trying to cut back the recipe a little, but ended up just making the whole thing. So my bf and I have been eating it all week. But, hey, we sure don't mind. I didn't know what kind of onion or potato to use, so I just kept it common. I used small red onions and regular Russett, but I think you could get away with a smaller potatoes too. Serving 6 - so this makes a lot. Very tasty, thank you! Chnang na! heeehee"
134011,245936,3/19/2011,5,Absolute comfort food!  Really yummy.  It also makes lots of sauce & was wonderful over rice & veg.  I also used 1/2 chilli powder due to younger family and it was nicely warm for our tastes.  Great recipe!  This is the last of 3 made for PAC 2011
280271,250609,4/5/2008,5,"I have to give this a 5 star. I don't care for Quinoa. DH love this stuff. I prepared this for him today and took a taste like I always do...and thought ooh this is good. You can taste all the flavors, but the mint is most dominate without being overpowering. If there is a recipe that will make me a Quinoa lover this is it.... Made for PAC spring 08"""
351321,250609,7/21/2012,5,"Love this recipe!!  This is the only recipe I use to make quinoa.  I omit the onions, because my husband is allergic.  So I usually add onion powder to make up for the flavor.  I always add more cranberries than the recipe says - just because I think they are delicious."
29782,256397,11/5/2007,5,I absolutely LOVED this!! I almost ate the whole thing at dinner by myself :)  YUM! this is one I know I will make many of times. Thank you so much for sharing!
278639,281620,2/4/2008,5,"I have made salmon patties from many different recipes, looking for one that I really liked, and THIS IS IT!!  It is my favorite, and so simple.  The saltines are what makes a great improvement in taste over other recipes.  Thanks, Cheri, for posting a winner (and so simple)"
693345,281620,9/17/2008,5,"This is a great recipe! I have never made salmon patties before, and I am so glad I chose this recipe! I did add a few things, however. I added a shake of dried parsley leaves from one of the big honkin' containers, which probably equated to about 2 Tablespoons. I also added a couple shakes of paprika, for a little bit of spice (maybe about 1 tsp., or a little less). I also added a shake of garlic powder from the same type of honkin' container (probably about 1 tsp. or so). I don't really measure spices for stuff like this.... I dumped most of the salmon juice (eww...salmon juice) out, but I saved about a tablespoon and put it back in the mixture, just for a tad more moistness. I used canola oil to fry, and I rolled the patties in balls a little bigger than golf balls, then pressed them to about 3/4"" thick. Cooking time was right-on. My husband really liked them, and I did too. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! :)"
268741,290180,3/19/2012,4,These turned out ok - you must SUPER FINELY CHOP the walnuts or the egg just kid of settled on the bottom- would have been good to have that in the instruction - but the taste seemed right for Persian sweets and I will try again next weekend for a Nowruz Celebration - Thank you for the recipe!
1480551,290180,3/23/2016,5,"Lovely cookie. Enjoyed by all. Agree with previous reviewer. The walnuts must be chopped very finely. I didn&#039;t have the problem of the egg yolks settling to the bottom, but I think from a texture stand-point more finely chopped walnuts is better."
645231,336795,11/28/2008,5,"I made this the other night for dinner and it was fantastic!  I serve it with garden salads and nothing else and it was plenty filling.  The only change I made was using extra cheese (wanted to use up the rest of the block I had), therefore I had to add 2 extra eggs.  I changed nothing else and it came out beautifully!  We love quiche in our house and now we have a new recipe for life.  Thanks Trinkets!"
200862,336795,11/5/2011,5,"Trinkets, I apologise for having had to use zucchini instead of spinach -- our only decent shop had neither fresh nor frozen! I liked your recipe for its simplicity and creaminess!! Didn't change anything else (I used 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk). I hope 5 stars show up, because the new format and colours have me confused! This quiche is soft and creamy, and quite delicious. Next time I WILL do it with spinach. Thanks!!"
2001848839,336795,12/10/2017,0,"Five stars for sure! Awesome! Substituted unsweetened almond milk, vanilla flavored, instead of regular milk. You have to try this! Was so moist and best flavor I have tasted. Great recipe! Thanks!"
107583,373842,12/5/2009,5,"Delicious quiche!  I didn't use a frozen crust, but did use a ready-made one.  I also made this a bit ""quicker"" by using pre-cooked crumbled bacon.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg, because it is a flavor I like in quiche.  Thanks for a quick, tasty dinner!"
2149976,73513,1/16/2012,5,Great summer garden salad !!
487088,373842,2/3/2013,5,"Lots of awesome goodness! So easy. I liked Mikekey's idea of using pre-cooked bacon and that did save some time. I always have that on hand. I'll absolutely make this again and next time I plan to thrown in some chopped spinach, I can also see using ham and cheddar cheese with some broccoli. So many possibilities."
461834,373842,9/22/2013,5,"Wonderful quiche!!  I made 1/3 of the recipe and used a recipe from my &quot;Small Batch Baking&quot; cookbook for the pie crust which made one mini pie/quiche to serve two.  I served it with some fresh fruit and blueberry muffins, yummy brunch!!  Made for your win in the football pool game, congrats again!!"
176615,373842,7/2/2014,5,Good simple to fix quiche. Made my own pie crust and cooked the bacon in the oven. Next time I may use green onions rather than saut&eacute;ed onion. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
2000688819,373842,11/17/2015,5,"FANTASTIC!!!! I tweaked it a wee bit:  sauteed onions, mushrooms and spinach.  Then added this to the egg mixture.  Also used bacon chips - which is soy bacon bits.  ABSOLUTELY DIVINE.........."
615758,373842,6/24/2018,5,"Made this for dinner last night and had it for breakfast too!! It is very good and easy to make. I had a frozen pie crust, made up the bacon and onion as directed, but I didn't have half and half so I just used 2% milk and it came out fine. I did throw in some cheddar and jack that I had in addition to the swiss and also some chopped spinach. It turned out terrific!! I would recommend to anyone."
655199,381108,7/15/2009,3,"This was pretty good, but could've used a little more seasoning IMO...couldn't really taste the Worcestershire sauce. Granddaughter's (7 & 3) loved it! Will make it again, but will add some seasonings. THANKS!"
86318,30968,9/11/2003,5,"This is a lovely recipe for hot weather. I cut it back to 1/2 pound tomatoes, which came to about 2 medium ones. It's such a simple recipe, but I don't think I would have thought to do it myself, and now that I've made it, I can think about adding other things...like olives or even anchovies. Thank you, Pat "
121690,30968,8/1/2004,5,"Great recipe during the summer tomato-growing season, and wonderful for somebody like me who is avoiding salt. With all the herbs you don't miss it.  I used your recipe as a base, substituting fresh for dried basil, then added in sauteed mushrooms and zucchini and ate it over fettucini.  I'll definitely make it again!"
40114,30968,8/5/2006,5,"This really is a lovely recipe. I don't easily give a five-star rating, bit thos one deserves it. Don't hesitate to use more tomatoes if you are a tomato-lover (like I am)."
1198738,30968,8/7/2010,4,"DH really liked this.  I thought it was just okay.  However, when there is a plethora of fresh tomatos in the kitchen, this is an excellent way to use them.  Hubby even ate the leftovers cold out of the fridge, and he may have even lickied the bowl!"
362734,44235,5/17/2007,5,This was a really fun snack mix. My kids enjoyed it and it kept them busy on a long car ride. This will be great for our hiking trips as there is no chocolate to melt. I used blueberry yogurt cheerios and chocolate teddy grahams.Thanks for this recipe!
285039,44235,4/26/2008,5,"What a cute concept!  Never would I have thought of making trail mix with animal cookies and teddy grahams!  I, too, used chocolate Teddy Grahams but used chocolate skittles instead of fruit snacks and peanuts instead of raisins.  Kids love it! Thanks!"
369975,44235,8/21/2008,5,A very popular recipe for a office party.  I also used chocolate Teddy Grahams and different character shaped fruit snacks.  Everyone was shocked that it was so good and so easy to make.  I will be serving this again the future.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
326787,44235,12/22/2008,4,"Mixed up for a Christmas snack gift for my mother and father, something that sounded not too sweet. I did use the frosted Cherrios and chocolate Teddy Grahams as suggested. This sounded like a good choice, and I think it will be. Thanks..."
85707,44235,9/11/2009,5,Easy and so cute!  We are having a family birthday party and there will be several little ones attending.  I made up a batch and tested it on my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter and 18 year old daughter.  They both loved it.
38643,44235,9/13/2009,5,My grandkids had fun making and eating this today!
143917,44235,10/30/2009,5,This is addictive!! I made it for DD to take on a road trip where it lasted about 20 minutes.  Sent some in a care package to DS with the same results.  Doubled the recipe but next time will have to quadruple!!! Thanks for a sweeeeeeet recipe!
103876,44235,7/27/2010,5,"I pulled this up in a hurry today to make a relatively healthy snack-mix for our upcoming vacation.  We used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey roasted peanuts, cheerios, raisins and fruit snacks.  It is very addictive!  Thanks for posting."
29418,44235,2/2/2011,5,"I was searching on a snack mix that would be relatively healthy and fun for my three year old as she was getting tired of the same 'ole stuff... So I used chocolate animal crackers, pretzels, honey graham bears, honey nut cheerios, raisins and smiley fruit snacks...  It's very good...I love it and she seems to as well...Thanks for sharing!"
394543,57562,12/31/2006,3,"I liked these but they don't rise much more than a couple inches Atleast mine did not."
215969,97183,2/6/2006,5,"I've made this twice now. Got it just right the second time. The recipe doesn't specify where to add the tomatoes, so I put them in with the zucchini and other vegies for frying. I found 1 medium to large eggplant and 1 zucchini is about right. The eggplant I diced and sprayed with oil and then microwaved for 4-5 minutes. The vegies I just fried with a bit more spray. The first time I made it I didn't remove enough of the tomato fluid and it came out a bit soggy. The second time I used phyllo pastry and made individual large serve pies. Rave reviews. Thanks so much for the recipe - this is definitely a keeper!."
234075,97183,6/21/2008,5,"This was excellent. I microwaved the eggplant, like Andrea-Oz did, and used much less oil overall. Since I had fresh basil on hand, I used that instead of dried. And I had grape tomatoes, so I threw those in. I also used about 2/3 of the amount of cheese, to keep the fat and calories down. Finally, I used the Greek Baking Powder Pie Crust, Recipe #146530 , to keep it healthy. Awesome. Will make again. Thank you for posting."
2001782143,97183,11/7/2017,5,This exact recipe came from a Betty Crocker Book from the 1970's. I could not find myt book so I checked the web. So happy to find it here. No tweaks necessary. It is perfect.
148715,152122,12/30/2006,5,We did a large dinner party for my daughters 17th birthday.  Our theme was Greek and this dip fit the bill.  I shredded the cucumber and squeezed it so it wouldn't make the dip runny.  The dip was a hit and will get made next time I need to do a greek party.
953275,152122,7/11/2009,5,"This just goes to show you sometimes DO need a recipe for the simplest of things!!  :)  Thanks Brew, this turned out really well.  I used balkan style (thick) yogurt and still drained it for the day in the fridge.  I also followed your instructions and seeded & chopped as opposed to grating/squeezing like I normally do.  It's really pretty perfect!  Thanks, won't go back now."
1206102,152122,2/25/2010,5,"Delicious.  I did have real Greek yogurt, but no dill, so I minced some fresh mint (about 2 T).  Great with baby carrots!"
338384,152122,8/15/2011,5,"I just noticed that I never rated this recipe and I must make this at least twice a month!  Seriously, I love this dip, especially with pita bread.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!"
150281,163370,10/12/2007,5,"FANTASTIC! I saved this for a special occation and it was a great hit. This is a great recipe for the autumn. My husband loves these, that is a high review in this house. I think this is a recipe that we will be keeping and using again! Thank you for posting!!"
803717,163370,3/31/2008,5,I made these for a sunday special at the restaurant I work at. they are spectacular! I modified it slightly by making my own tapioca pudding (cheaper when you need to make a large quantity) and I substituted carmel extract for the brandy. they were served warm with sauteed granny smith apples on top and drizzled with a homemade carmel sauce....rave reviews from all of my customers!!! thank you so much for the recipe. I will definetely make these again!!!
269521,205218,9/3/2009,5,"So simple and very tasty!   I cut the recipe done for two. Instead of canned green chilies, I substitued roasted poblano (diced) and used left over fresh sweet corn!  Also added left over diced chicken to mine (DH doesn't do chicken).  My process was  a little different;  I toasted one side of the tortillas on the griddle, flipped over; then added the filling and folded.  Served with fresh salsa.  YUM!    Thanks for sharing!"
246482,217012,7/4/2018,4,Very nice I got 18 muffins out of it but I think my tins were smaller. Next time ill add a bit more coconut or sprinkle a bit on the tops before baking Made for world tour 2018 for the Pantry Pirates.
1145795,229942,1/26/2009,5,"For my project on Ethiopia in world history, I chose to make the national dish.  The original recipe I chose called for teff flour but unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere."
1110776,78274,5/15/2014,5,Love it!
213139,378032,7/19/2009,5,"Made for New Kid on the Block Tag.  These chicken thighs are out of this world.  I originally thought that they would be rather spicy, but they weren't.  Love the color that the cumin put on the meat and you could really taste it.  The only two things about this recipe are ~ the ingredients are not in the order that they are used (might be confusing for a new cook and thus I forgot the cilantro) and the sauce needed to be thickened a little, which I did.  Regardless this is a great recipe and I will use it again!  Thanks for posting this!"
829250,378032,7/23/2014,4,"Made this because it looked quick! It was good!!! Didn&#039;t blow me away or anything. Thinking maybe tomorrow it will be better after all the flavors blend. There was a lot of liquid. Tried to add some corn starch to thicken it up but it didn&#039;t do much. Made with a side of beans and sauted red potatoe, zucchini, and carrots. Added sliced avacado too."
1170714,241799,6/20/2011,5,This is excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and still had more than enough for what I needed.  I also used more powdered sugar than called for because I wanted a thick filling that wouldn't bulge between the layers.  I could eat it with a spoon it's soooo good!
1333844,241799,2/26/2012,5,"I tried this filling and it was really good. I made a 1/4 sized recipe to try it and it was a lot, but was it good!? I followed it to the T and it turned out great. Will post pics soon."
63858,260554,10/24/2007,5,"This was awesome!  We loved it.  Will definately make again.  The only change I made was I used dried cilantro instead of fresh.  Thanks made for PAC Fall 07. Lisa"
128541,260554,11/21/2010,5,This soup is absolutely the yummiest soup I've had!  So much flavor and so quick!  Thanks for posting it here!
133174,260554,11/19/2017,5,A perfect soup for a cool autumn evening. I used rotisserie chicken breast meat and the soup was ready on the table is less than 30 minutes. It is well seasoned and something I am sure to make again.
865936,278119,6/12/2010,5,"I made this into individual meatloaves and they were terrific!  I love Mediterranean ingredients.  I always think I don't like mint (in any form), but actually I do!  Thanks for posting.  This will certainly be made again."
1803719199,278119,1/28/2015,5,This is my favorite meatloaf. We started buying half a lamb every year. I wasn&#039;t sure what to do with the ground lamb. So off I went to search out yummy things to make. I have made this several times now and it always is a delight for those I share it with. Super easy but oh so tasty. Thank you for sharing this.
2002330544,278119,11/13/2018,4,"This is the best meatloaf I have ever made, Moist, flavorful, everyone loved it. Not 5 star because I am just conservative like that."
1235950,285168,4/12/2009,3,"I followed the recipe as listed. Full of flavor. The eggs cooked evenly. I laid the steamer bag flat. The texture was spongy throughout and soggy on the bottom. Convenient way of cooking eggs, but I rather use a pan. Thanks."
592157,299530,3/3/2010,5,This was simple to make and had a very nice flavor.
1600888,299530,4/19/2010,5,Love this soup!  It's so easy to make and is very authentic!  Thank you!
766849,299530,8/1/2010,5,"Yum!!!  I think this is the same soup my Korean friend used to order for me (she and the people at the restaurant spoke so quickly I couldn't follow any of it)... it came in individual bowls and we cracked a raw egg into our boiling bowls of soup... a great addition, in my book.  Thanks for posting!"
812019,317541,1/25/2009,4,I picked this recipe from Recipezaar at the same time my wife picked it from BH&G. We make it with Chicken tenderloins and serve over rice.
136997,328012,1/9/2009,5,"I love caremilzed onions, so I had to try this. Didn't change a thing. Delicious! :)"
160977,328012,7/1/2009,5,"This is so good! There were two things that I did not have on hand. Fresh thyme and tomatoes. Solution: used 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes from a can. Worked perfectly. When the jam was ready it seemed a bit ""wet"", I decided to leave most of the liquid in the pan and scrape the jam together. Wanted to taste it as soon as it was done and found it a bit too sweet. But-once cooled (actually the day after) it was not overly sweet at all, had a jam-like consistency and a zing from the red pepper flakes. A little of this onion jam on a cheese sandwich, mmmmmmmmm.  It has many more uses but I keep putting it on my sandwich, can't stay away from it. Yes, indeed delicious. Thanks for posting."
601528,328012,2/19/2010,5,I reduced the recipe by 1/3 with great success.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to chop up the onions instead of slicing.  It was a bit difficult to eat for me.  I thought this was delicious and went well with my tomato and balsamic vinegar chicken that I made for dinner last night.  I slathered this on some homemade rolls.
318262,328012,9/18/2011,5,This was delicious! I didn't end up canning or storing any because we wanted to eat it all right away (I scaled the recipe down). I also added a tad more balsamic since I love the stuff and cut down a bit on the sugar. Topped burgers with these lovely onions. Thanks so much for sharing!
2633368,328012,5/1/2015,5,"OMG!  This is SO good!"
